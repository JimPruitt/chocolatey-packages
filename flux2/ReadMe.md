## Declarative desired state for Kubernetes

An optional command line client for Flux that allows you to access a running cloud deploy daemon.

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster matches the config in git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don't need a separate CD tool. It monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers deployments and updates the desired running configuration based on that (and a configurable policy).
