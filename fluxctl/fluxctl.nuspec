    <description># Flux legacy CLI

### Managing Flux from the Command Line
> Notice! [Flux v1 is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320). The next iteration of the Flux command line interface (v2) is being renamed to '[flux](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/flux)'.  Please refer to [this issue for detailed information](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320). 

Flux allows you to declaratively define the deployment state of your Kubernetes environment.  Deployements are automated and triggered off of code pushes.
Flux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster matches your specified configuration in git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don't need a separate CD tool.
    It monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers deployments and updates the desired running configuration based on that (and a configurable policy).

### Additional Documentation

More information can be found at the official [FluxCD site](https://fluxcd.io/) and [Flux GitHub repository](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux).
